# MurMur
MurMur is a silent local agent that detects and auto-fixes common technical issues like Wi-Fi drops or frozen processes. Modular, real-time, and fully automated â€” it works quietly in the background to keep your system smooth without interruptions.

## GUI Front-end

A basic Tkinter interface is provided in `gui.py`.
Run it with:

```bash
python gui.py
```

It will let you start or stop MurMur from a small window.
